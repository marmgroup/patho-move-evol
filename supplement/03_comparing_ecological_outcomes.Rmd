# Comparing ecological outcomes across parameter combinations

![**Rapid changes in population ecological outcomes following pathogen introduction.** The introduction of the infectious pathogen leads to rapid evolutionary changes in movement strategies (see Figures 1 and 5; main text) across most combinations of landscape productivity and infection cost. In all combinations where there is rapid evolutionary shift in social-movement strategies, there is a similar change in the population's ecological outcomes: more movement, less intake, and fewer associations. Only in scenarios where the mix of social-movement strategies does not change ($R \in$ 2, 5; $\delta E$ = 0.1), is there broadly no change in population ecological outcomes. ](figures/fig_eco_compare_default.png)
